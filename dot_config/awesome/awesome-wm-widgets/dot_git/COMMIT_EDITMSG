run-shell: adjustments for my theme

- use wibar_size to set the background position and size
- replace the "a" "logo" with the Arc terminal icon
- remove the "Run:" prompt text and set prompt background to
  transparent.
- rename "suspend_button" to "poweroff_button"  as it actually shuts
  down the machine rather than suspends it.
- use "systemctl poweroff" as the poweroff command
- add margin to the poweroff button
- replace the custom icon in the warning notification with the standard
  Arc warning-dialog icon.
